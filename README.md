# odin-recipes
A website that consists of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes

Welcome to my TOP learning project

In this website project, I'm going to use my learned basics in the use of Git, GitHub, HTML and the Unix command line.

This project is basically The Odin Project giving me the assignment to create a website with a few links to pages with recipes in them. That's all there is.

This is the first project I ever published on GitHub and I invite you to take a look at it and give me some feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Have a nice day!
